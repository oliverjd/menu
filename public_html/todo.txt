BEFORE FIRST RELEASE:

mainpane footer is blocking clicks of footer links



- make the lunch/dinner sections collapsible with a >> icon or something?
- create google manifest
- make a home-screen icon
- implement app caching
- implement a nice spinner/loading screen/icon
- make it handle gracefully when it can't read the post or parse it
- make it ignore the first post if it's a formal hall menu and use the second instead
- a pop-up for each of ios and android (different location?) to prompt user to install web-app on home-screen (using html5 local storage to keep track of first time only shown) see cubiq app

EVENTUAL FEATURES:
- formal hall menus

done:

- fix the awful google engine by replacing with yql!
- make the "menu" blue bit at the top static so it stays put on screen (more app-like)
- make it display in two columns on desktop (i.e. wider than 768 or something) and also have side margins on a desktop (maybe phone try that too)
- try small white margin above top bar to see if it looks better
- make the footer links work and an "about this app" pop-over
