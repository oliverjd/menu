# The Menu

I got frustrated with the rather clunky format of the Pembroke catering blog and their online menus, so I made a web-app to display them quickly and cleanly.

Note: the college has stopped posting daily menus to their catering blog, so The Menu will no longer be updated. (Also, Yahoo has discontinued their public YQL API so it wouldn't work anymore anyway.) I have hardcoded the site to display the menu of my year's last day in college, 26 June 2018, for posterity.
